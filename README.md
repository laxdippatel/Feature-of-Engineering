# Feature Engineering & Feature Selection
## Motivation

Feature Engineering & Selection is the most essential part of building a useable machine learning project, even though hundreds of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms coming in these days like deep learning and transfer learning. Indeed, like what Prof Domingos, the author of  'The Master Algorithm' says:

> “At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used.”
